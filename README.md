A startup I am working on. This is the sample prototype of the actual website.
1] ALL the files named index are related and they make the landingpage of the site. The first page includes the logo of the company, signup,login and start buliding - leads to second page. Smooth scroll is also used to make the page scroll down.
2] Files named Second are related and this page is the login page. As we click the signin button in index page this page pops up. This page has circles floating in the background with animation and sign up page is linked with this page.
3] Files named Third are related and this page is the signup page. As we click the signup button in index page this page pops up. This page has circles floating in the background with animation and sign up page is linked with this page.
4] Files named fourth are related and connected and this is the second page of the site. This page displays the linear-gradient used in the background. The header contains various titles. Lawyers  title has a dropdown list in it made with the help of css. The user can select a type of lawyer from this list. 
5] When clicking on the contracts title the contract page opens and this page displays how the contracts are to be created. Below that a flowchart has been made with the help of css to guide the user and lastly we have two buttons for templates and AI -generation. With the use of javascript it has been connected.
